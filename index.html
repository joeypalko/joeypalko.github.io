      <p>About two years ago, I became seriously interested in what was going on around the world - conflict, diplomacy, poverty, famine, among other things. These most persistent human problems are best solved, I believe, by even more persistently devoted humans. I think my faith guides me in that belief. Raised Catholic, It’s always been my understanding that we are supposed to help those in need: the poor, the sick, the prisoners, the strangers in our land. I believe that surrendering to these forces in the world, retreating to our corners, and hunkering down aren’t truly options because of how interconnected these issues are. These problems generate new dilemmas and difficult choices that my curiosity struggles to reconcile. How are we supposed to reconcile principles of sovereignty with the demands for human rights? While we want to maintain a status quo where nations are sovereign in their own right, we cannot be naive and ignore the fact that not every country is a western-style liberal democracy like ours. Values are different around the world, and thus the expectations of governments differ. How do we reconcile these differences to establish any sort of international standard? To these questions, I simply do not yet have well-educated answers that the world is worthy of. Well-educated, well-thought-out solutions are what the world needs to deal with these problems, and by studying international politics I hope to one day be worthy of contributing such opinions and ideas to the world.
