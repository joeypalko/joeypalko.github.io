      <p>About two years ago, I became seriously interested in what was going on around the world - conflict, diplomacy, poverty, famine, among other things. These most persistent human problems are best solved, I believe, by even more persistently devoted humans. I think my faith guides me in that belief. Raised Catholic, It’s always been my understanding that we are supposed to help those in need: the poor, the sick, the prisoners, the strangers in our land. I believe that surrendering to these forces in the world, retreating to our corners, and hunkering down aren’t truly options because of how interconnected these issues are. These problems generate new dilemmas and difficult choices that my curiosity struggles to reconcile. How are we supposed to reconcile principles of sovereignty with the demands for human rights? While we want to maintain a status quo where nations are sovereign in their own right, we cannot be naive and ignore the fact that not every country is a western-style liberal democracy like ours. Values are different around the world, and thus the expectations of governments differ. How do we reconcile these differences to establish any sort of international standard? To these questions, I simply do not yet have well-educated answers that the world is worthy of. Well-educated, well-thought-out solutions are what the world needs to deal with these problems, and by studying international politics I hope to one day be worthy of contributing such opinions and ideas to the world.

      <p>On the surface, I suppose I don’t necessarily appear to be the most diverse person. I am a white male from a white town. Maybe in that regard I have everything to gain from diversity. But, to gain anything from diversity requires a participation in it through communication. By engaging in communication with people who look, pray, or think differently than you might isn’t a simple feat and shouldn’t be underestimated. If you make communication center to your interactions with those around you, if you participate in open and honest dialogue you are already making a few key assumptions. First, by engaging in dialogue with someone different from you, you are rejecting the evil of stereotype and understanding that everyone is unique with unique experiences. By communicating, you aren’t making assumptions or judgements of a certain group of people, you are valuing the individual and the experiences of others. Second, when you engage in communication you are humbly admitting to ignorance. Before communication, we are all ignorant to the experiences of each other. Engaging with someone of a different faith, politics, race, gender, or any other identifying factor that society seems to compartmentalize us into lifts the veil of ignorance and allows us to share in a mutual respect for the experiences of each other. The way I contribute to diversity is by participating in it up close and personally. I don’t want to appreciate diversity from afar or allow my ignorance to project hate on others at a distance.

      <p>Mount Pleasant, North Carolina is my hometown and I love it with all my heart. Delicious food, decent people, and accents as thick as the mud found at the “Tough Mudder” race that our town has proudly hosted for years. My town stands as a sort of oasis in a county on the rise - a town with an innate quality as a great place to start or grow a family; much like my family did after moving into the area in 1997. Growth from the Charlotte area is creeping eastward rapidly, bringing with it all sorts of wonderful change. What I fear about my hometown is that the absolute obstinance many have within it against any sort of change or growth will do as much harm to the charm of our town as simply surrendering to the forces of growth and suburbanization inching across our county. Like any other town or city, Mount Pleasant needs to grow and change to stay alive. If we deny change in any form thereby surrendering our ability to control and craft change and growth in our town, we may lose our town and the qualities of it that we want to preserve. Growth does not have to contradict the charm of our town. Standing firm in admiration for what makes our town great, and harnessing the forces of growth with that vision in mind, we can build upon our town a better, long-lasting version of itself.
